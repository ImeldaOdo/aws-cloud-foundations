# AWS Cloud Foundations Project: EC2 Web Server Deployment

This project documents my hands-on experience deploying a static website on an Amazon EC2 instance using Amazon Linux 2023 and NGINX. The goal was to understand the fundamentals of cloud infrastructure, secure remote access, and basic web server configuration using AWS.

---

## Project Overview

In this project, I:
- Launched an EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2023
- Configured secure access using SSH and key pairs
- Set up and customized AWS security groups to control inbound traffic
- Installed and enabled NGINX as a web server
- Deployed and verified a static website accessible via the instance’s public IP address

This project helped me build confidence working directly in the AWS console and Linux command line while reinforcing cloud security best practices.

## EC2 Instance Access (SSH)

I connected to the EC2 instance securely using SSH and a `.pem` key pair. Proper file permissions were set on the key to allow authentication.

## System Update & NGINX Installation

After connecting to the instance, I updated system packages and installed NGINX using the default Amazon Linux repositories. The NGINX service was then started and enabled to run on boot.

## Security Group Configuration

To secure the instance, I configured AWS security groups with the following inbound rules:
- **SSH (port 22)** – restricted for secure remote access
- **HTTP (port 80)** – open to allow public web traffic

This ensured the server was accessible only where necessary while maintaining security.

## Deployed Website

Once NGINX was running, I verified the deployment by accessing the instance’s public IP address in a browser. The static webpage confirms that the web server is correctly installed and publicly accessible.

## Key Takeaways

Through this project, I gained practical experience with:
- AWS EC2 instance management
- Linux server administration
- SSH authentication and key management
- Network security using AWS security groups
- Deploying and validating a web server in the cloud

This project represents my first end-to-end cloud deployment and serves as a foundation for more advanced AWS and DevOps work.
